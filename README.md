# BharaDibo - an online rent management system

The BharaDibo website is an online rent management system that allows users to upload and browse products available for rent. Admin roles have access to user accounts, product information, and homepage oversight. The website also performs data backups and customizes functionalities. It is written in PHP and MS SQL (ASP.NET). 
The BharaDibo website is a valuable tool for both renters and landlords. It provides a convenient way to manage rental properties and find products to rent. <br />

It's one of our university projects on ASP.NET. Some snapshots of our project are given below. <br /> <br />
